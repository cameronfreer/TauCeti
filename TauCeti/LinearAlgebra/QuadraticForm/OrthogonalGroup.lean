# The orthogonal group of a quadratic form

Mathlib knows the orthogonal group only in matrix form: `Matrix.orthogonalGroup n R` is the group of
matrices `A` with `Aᵀ * A = 1` (`Matrix.mem_orthogonalGroup_iff'`). Such matrices preserve the
*standard* form `x ↦ ∑ i, x i ^ 2` on `n → R`, and, as soon as `2` is not a zero divisor in `R`,
they are exactly its isometries: evaluating `Q (A x) = Q x` at the basis vectors and their pairwise
sums says that `Aᵀ * A` has unit diagonal and that twice each off-diagonal entry vanishes. In
characteristic two the two notions part company, since there the standard form no longer sees the
off-diagonal entries at all. For an abstract quadratic map `Q : QuadraticMap R M N` the
corresponding group is missing, even though Mathlib does have the individual isometries as
`QuadraticMap.IsometryEquiv Q Q`: what it lacks is the observation that they form a subgroup of the
linear automorphism group `M ≃ₗ[R] M`, and hence a group to act with.

This file supplies that subgroup, together with its determinant-one subgroup and the reflections in
the hyperplanes of vectors of invertible norm. The orthogonal group is the target of the
twisted-conjugation homomorphism out of the Pin group, so it is the object the Pin/Spin double
covers are stated against, and the reflections are the generators an eventual Cartan-Dieudonné
theorem factors an orthogonal automorphism into. Nothing here assumes the hypotheses that theorem
needs (a field of characteristic not two, a nondegenerate form, finite dimension); the declarations
below hold over an arbitrary commutative ring. The characteristic restriction is not incidental: in
characteristic two `polar Q v v = 2 • Q v` vanishes, so `reflection Q v` fixes `v` instead of
negating it and is a transvection rather than a reflection in `v ^ ⊥`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.orthogonalGroup Q`: the `Q`-preserving linear automorphisms of `M`, as a
  subgroup of `M ≃ₗ[R] M`.
* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.specialOrthogonalGroup Q`: its determinant-one subgroup.
* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.reflection Q v`: the reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to a vector `v`
  with `Q v` invertible, built from Mathlib's `Module.reflection`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.polar_apply_of_mem_orthogonalGroup`: an orthogonal automorphism preserves
  the polarization of `Q`; it preserves the orthogonality relation as well
  (`isOrtho_iff_of_mem_orthogonalGroup`). As soon as `2` acts injectively on the target the
  converse holds, `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.mem_orthogonalGroup_iff_polar`, which is the usual
  identification of the isometries of a quadratic form with the isometries of its polar bilinear
  form.
* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.orthogonalGroupEquivIsometryEquiv`: the underlying set of the orthogonal
  group is Mathlib's type of self-isometries `Q.IsometryEquiv Q`. This is the compatibility with the
  Mathlib vocabulary; the point of `orthogonalGroup` is the group structure, which
  `QuadraticMap.IsometryEquiv` does not carry.
* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.orthogonalGroupCongr`: isometric quadratic maps have isomorphic orthogonal
  groups. Over an algebraically closed field this is what makes `O(Q)` depend only on the rank of
  `Q`.
* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.reflection_mem_orthogonalGroup`: the reflection in a vector of invertible
  norm is orthogonal; `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.reflection_mul_self` says it is an involution, and
  `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.reflection_apply_of_isOrtho` that it fixes the orthogonal hyperplane. These
  are the elements a Cartan-Dieudonné theorem would write an orthogonal automorphism as a product
  of, under hypotheses (a field of characteristic not two, a nondegenerate form, finite dimension)
  that are not assumed here, and the image of the Pin group's generating vectors under twisted
  conjugation.
* `TauCeti.QuadraticMap.specialOrthogonalGroup_normal`: `SO(Q)` is normal in `O(Q)`, being the
  kernel of the determinant restricted there.

## Implementation notes

`orthogonalGroup` is defined for a `QuadraticMap R M N` valued in an arbitrary module `N`, since
preserving `Q` makes sense at that generality. The file is therefore laid out by hypothesis
strength: the group itself, its identification with `IsometryEquiv`, and its transport along an
isometric equivalence need only a `CommSemiring` and additive monoids; the polarization needs
subtraction in `M` and `N`, since `QuadraticMap.polar` is stated for `[AddCommGroup M]
[AddCommGroup N]`, but still no more than a `CommSemiring`; the determinant needs `M` to be an
additive group over a `CommRing`, and the
reflections need to divide by `Q v` and so are stated for a `QuadraticForm R M`, that is, for
`N = R`.
