# Positive definiteness of an integer matrix, over the integers and over the rationals

`Matrix.PosDef` is stated relative to the coefficient ring, so for a matrix of integers it says
that the associated quadratic form is positive on nonzero *integer* vectors. That is formally
weaker than positivity on nonzero *rational* vectors, and it is the rational statement that later
arguments want, since a rational vector may be built from a construction that does not respect
denominators. This file records one implication: an integer matrix that is positive definite over
`ℤ` stays positive definite after casting its entries into `ℚ`.

The proof is the obvious one. A nonzero rational vector becomes a nonzero integer vector after
multiplying by a common denominator, and the quadratic form scales by the square of that
denominator, which is positive. The index type need not be finite: a test vector for
`Matrix.PosDef` is finitely supported, so the general case follows from the finite one applied to
the principal submatrix on the support of the vector.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Matrix.posDef_map_intCast`: an integer matrix that is positive definite over `ℤ` is
  positive definite over `ℚ`.
