# Double cosets as orbits

For subgroups `H` and `K` of a group `G`, a double coset is an orbit in two ways.

The double coset `KsH` is the preimage in `G` of the `K`-orbit of the coset `sH`
(`TauCeti.preimage_orbit_eq_doubleCoset`), so the partition of `G ⧸ H` into `K`-orbits is the
partition of `G` into `K`-`H` double cosets.

Globally, the diagonal action of `G` on `(G ⧸ H) × (G ⧸ K)` has
orbits in bijection with the double cosets `H \ G / K`: the orbit of `(aH, bK)` is recorded by the
double coset `H a⁻¹ b K`, and every orbit meets the slice `{(H, gK) | g : G}`.

Combining that bijection with Burnside's lemma counts double cosets by a sum of fixed-point
numbers, which is the group-theoretic half of the statement that the permutation character of
`G` on `G ⧸ H` pairs with the permutation character on `G ⧸ K` to `#(H \ G / K)`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.doubleCosetEquivOrbitQuotient`: the bijection
  `H \ G / K ≃ ((G ⧸ H) × (G ⧸ K)) / G`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.mem_doubleCoset_iff_mk_mem_orbit`: an element lies in `KsH` exactly when its coset
  lies in the `K`-orbit of `sH`.
* `TauCeti.preimage_orbit_eq_doubleCoset`: the double coset `KsH` is the preimage of the
  `K`-orbit of `sH`.
* `TauCeti.card_doubleCosetQuotient_eq_card_orbitQuotient`: the two sides of that bijection have
  the same cardinality.
* `TauCeti.sum_card_fixedBy_mul_card_fixedBy_eq_card_doubleCosetQuotient_mul_card_group`:
  Burnside's lemma read through that bijection,
  `∑ g, |(G ⧸ H)^g| * |(G ⧸ K)^g| = #(H \ G / K) * |G|`.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's `DoubleCoset.Quotient (H : Set G) K` takes the two subgroups as sets, and its
representatives multiply as `h * a * k`. The bijection below is built from the slice map
`g ↦ orbit of (H, gK)`, which is surjective because `a • (H, a⁻¹bK) = (aH, bK)`, and injective
because the pair `(aH, bK)` determines `H a⁻¹ b K`.
