# The slash sum over a double-coset decomposition

A Hecke operator acts on a modular form by slashing it against representatives of the double
coset and summing. This file defines that sum and records that it is `ℂ`-linear in `f`.

⚠ **It is not yet an action, and on a general `f : ℍ → ℂ` it is not even well defined.**
`heckeSlashSum` is a sum over *chosen* representatives — `D.out` for the double coset and
`i.out` for each of its left cosets — and on an arbitrary function the choice changes the
answer: replacing `σᵢ` by `hσᵢ` for `h ∈ SL₂(ℤ)` multiplies the representative `(σᵢδ)ᵀ` by
`hᵀ` on the right, and `f ∣[k] (Xhᵀ) = (f ∣[k] X) ∣[k] hᵀ` differs from `f ∣[k] X` unless the
slash by `hᵀ` is trivial on that function. Even the identity double coset can therefore send a
raw `f` to `f ∣[k] h` rather than to `f`.

What repairs it is slash-invariance of `f`, and that is the proof of Shimura's Proposition
3.37: for `f` invariant under `SL₂(ℤ)` the sum is again invariant, because right multiplication
merely permutes the representatives. That theorem, and the descent of this sum to a genuine
operator on
`SlashInvariantForm` and `ModularForm`, are deliberately **not** in this file — the reindexing
argument is substantial and is a different claim. Until then this is an auxiliary sum, named to
say so, and every consumer must supply the invariance hypothesis itself.

## The transpose, and why it is here

The Hecke ring is built from the decomposition of `HδH` into **left** cosets `σᵢδH`
(`DoubleCoset.DecompQuotient`, and `LeftCosetModule/Basic.lean` in this repository). But the
slash action is a *right* action, so invariance of `∑ᵢ f ∣[k] Xᵢ` under `f ↦ f ∣[k] γ` needs
right multiplication by `γ` to permute the `Xᵢ` up to multiplication by `H` **on the left** —
that is, the `Xᵢ` must represent **right** cosets `HXᵢ`.

Transposition exchanges the two: if `HδH = ⊔ᵢ (σᵢδ)H` then `HδH = ⊔ᵢ H(δᵀσᵢᵀ)`, because
transposition is an anti-automorphism preserving `SL₂(ℤ)` and fixing every double coset. So the
representative used here is `(σᵢδ)ᵀ`, which is `transposeRep`.

The transpose is an artefact of which handedness Mathlib's `DecompQuotient` supplies, not of the
mathematics. Shimura decomposes `Γ₁αΓ₂ = ⊔ᵥ Γ₁aᵥ` — the group on the **left** — so his slash,
being a right action, permutes those representatives directly and no transpose ever appears.

⚠ Conventions: `gH` is a left coset and `Hg` a right one, as in Mathlib and in
`LeftCosetModule/Basic.lean`. AINTLIB's `HeckeAction.lean` uses the opposite labels for the
same objects; the mathematics is identical, the words are not.

Transposition is available as the anti-involution of `GLn/TransposeAntiInvolution.lean`, the
same one that proves the Hecke ring commutative; this file only needs that it preserves
`SL_n(ℤ)` and `Δ`.

## Positive determinants throughout

Every representative lies in `Δ = posDetInt 2`, so its determinant is positive, and that is what
makes the sum `ℂ`-linear: on the positive branch the slash action's conjugation `σ` is trivial
and scalars commute past it (`ModularForm.rat_smul_slash_of_det_pos`). Over a general
`GL(2, ℚ)`-element the twist is complex conjugation and linearity would fail.

## Main definitions

* `HeckeRing.GL2.transposeRep`: the transposed representative `(σᵢ δ)ᵀ`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum`: the choice-dependent sum `∑ᵢ f ∣[k] (σᵢ δ)ᵀ`.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.transposeRep_def`, `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_apply`: the characteristic
  equations, which are the interface since neither definition is `@[expose]`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.det_transposeRep_pos`: the representatives have positive determinant.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_add`, `heckeSlashSum_zero`, `heckeSlashSum_smul`: `ℂ`-linearity.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/HeckeAction.lean`](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB),
commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck): `transposeRep`,
its `heckeSlash` (renamed `heckeSlashSum` here, since it is not yet an action) and that
definition's additivity, zero and scalar lemmas. Restated
against TauCeti's `SLnZ`/`posDetInt` Hecke pair and `transposeGLEquiv` rather than AINTLIB's
`GL_pair`/`GL_transposeEquiv`.

⚠ This depends on the chosen representatives `D.out` and `i.out`, and on a general
`f : ℍ → ℂ` the value changes with them — see the module docstring. Slash-invariance of `f` is
*sufficient* to make it independent of the choices, and so an action; that is a separate
theorem. Whether it is also necessary is not claimed here — a particular `f` and `D` could be
independent by cancellation. Do not read this definition as "the Hecke operator" until the
sufficiency theorem is available. -/
