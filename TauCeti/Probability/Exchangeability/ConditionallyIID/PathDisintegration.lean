# The full-path joint disintegration

`ConditionallyIIDWith μ X ν` constrains the joint law of `(ν, block)` along each *finite* selection
of coordinates. This file upgrades that to the whole path at once: the joint law of the directing
measure together with the entire process is the disintegration `∫ δ_{ν ω} ⊗ (ν ω)^{⊗ℕ} dμ(ω)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.jointPathLaw_eq_iidMixtureLaw`

## Implementation

The right-hand side is not a new construction: `iidMixtureLaw (μ.map ν) id` is the canonical
two-stage law of `ConditionallyIID.Construct` — draw a probability measure from the mixing law
`μ.map ν`, then sample i.i.d. from it, keeping the drawn measure as a coordinate. So the theorem
says the abstract conditional predicate is *exactly* realised by that generative construction, which
is a stronger statement than naming a bespoke disintegration measure would be.

Both measures live on `ProbabilityMeasure α × (ℕ → α)`, and they agree on every finite prefix: the
joint law by the defining identity at the selection `Fin n → ℕ`, the mixture law by pushing the
`μ.map ν`-bind back along `ν` and projecting each fibre `δ_Q ⊗ Q^{⊗ℕ}` through
`map_prefixProj_infinitePi_const`. Extensionality then comes from
`ext_of_generate_finite` against the π-system `prefixSets` of preimages under the prefix maps
`prefixPair`:

* it is a π-system because two such sets can be re-presented at the longer of their two prefixes
  (`prefixPair_comp`);
* it generates the product σ-algebra, the first factor read off the empty prefix and the path factor
  through `MeasurableSpace.comap_iSup` on the coordinate evaluations.

Mathlib's `IsProjectiveLimit` is stated for pure dependent products `∀ i, α i`, so it does not apply
to this product directly; the π-system argument avoids reindexing the pair through `Option ℕ`.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 6 (directing measures) — the
  path-level form of the conditional disintegration the directing-measure layer is stated against.
* O. Kallenberg, *Probabilistic Symmetries and Invariance Principles* (Springer, 2005), §1.1, where
  the conditional predicate is stated blockwise.

The path-level form is what downstream work consumes — empirical measures as objects, the
affine/barycenter representation, and ergodic decomposition all read the joint law of `(ν, X)` in
one piece rather than block by block.

directing measure together with the *whole* path is the disintegration
`∫ δ_{ν ω} ⊗ (ν ω)^{⊗ℕ} dμ(ω)`.

upgrades it to the entire path at once. -/
