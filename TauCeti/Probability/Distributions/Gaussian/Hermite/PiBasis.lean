# The multi-index Hermite basis of a multivariate Gaussian `L²`

The `Fintype`-indexed product of the one-dimensional Gaussian Hermite basis: the multi-index family
`Ψ_a(x) = ∏ᵢ H_{aᵢ}(xᵢ)/√(aᵢ!)` is a Hilbert basis of `L²(γ^ι)`, the standard basis for
multivariate Gaussian `L²` and for chaos expansions.

Both inputs are already in place, so this file only combines them: `TauCeti.piHilbertBasis` builds
a Hilbert basis of `L²(Measure.pi μ)` from coordinatewise bases, and
`TauCeti.gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` is the one-dimensional factor.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.gaussianHermitePiBasis` — the multi-index basis.
* `TauCeti.coeFn_gaussianHermitePiBasis` — the anti-vacuity pin: the `a`-th vector really is the
  product `∏ᵢ H_{aᵢ}(xᵢ)/√(aᵢ!)`.
