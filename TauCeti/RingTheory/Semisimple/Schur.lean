# Schur's lemma for simple modules

This file packages the two forms of Schur's lemma used by the semisimple-algebra development.

For simple modules over an arbitrary ring, Mathlib proves that a linear map is either bijective or
zero (`LinearMap.bijective_or_eq_zero`). Consequently the entire hom group vanishes exactly when the
two modules are not linearly equivalent. When an equivalence does exist, Mathlib's
`LinearEquiv.arrowCongrAddEquiv` identifies the hom group with either endomorphism ring by
composition; no separate construction is needed here.

Over an algebraically closed field `k`, a domain algebra that is integral over `k` is `k` itself.
The proof uses Mathlib's theorem that the algebra map from an algebraically closed field into such
an algebra is bijective; a finite-dimensional division algebra is the special case that the roadmap
names, integrality there coming from finite dimensionality. The same collapse for the endomorphism
ring of a finite-dimensional simple module is
Mathlib's `IsSimpleModule.algebraMap_end_bijective_of_isAlgClosed`, packaged here as an algebra
equivalence.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hom_eq_zero_of_isEmpty_linearEquiv`: every map between inequivalent simple modules is
  zero.
* `TauCeti.subsingleton_linearMap_iff_isEmpty_linearEquiv`: the corresponding characterization of
  the whole hom group.
* `TauCeti.nontrivial_linearMap_iff_nonempty_linearEquiv`: two simple modules are equivalent exactly
  when their hom group is nontrivial.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_algEquiv_self_of_isIntegral`: a domain algebra over an algebraically closed
  field that is integral over that field is isomorphic to it as an algebra, with
  `TauCeti.nonempty_algEquiv_self_of_finiteDimensional_divisionRing` the finite-dimensional
  division algebra special case, also available under the name the roadmap pins,
  `TauCeti.algEquiv_self_of_finiteDimensional_divisionRing`.
* `TauCeti.endAlgEquivSelfOfIsSimpleModule`: the endomorphism ring of a finite-dimensional simple
  module over an algebraically closed field collapses to that field, canonically, as the inverse
  of the structure map; `TauCeti.nonempty_end_algEquiv_self_of_isSimpleModule` is its existence
  form.

/-- **Schur's lemma over an algebraically closed field.** The endomorphism ring of a
finite-dimensional simple module over a `k`-algebra is the field `k` itself.

Mathlib's `IsSimpleModule.algebraMap_end_bijective_of_isAlgClosed` proves that every such
endomorphism is a scalar; this packages that bijection as an algebra equivalence. Finite
dimensionality is needed: an infinite-dimensional simple module can have a larger division
endomorphism ring.

The equivalence involves no choices: it is the inverse of the structure map `k → End A S`, which
Schur's lemma proves bijective. Its inverse is therefore `algebraMap` on the nose, and the scalar
attached to an endomorphism is characterized by
`TauCeti.endAlgEquivSelfOfIsSimpleModule_smul`. -/
