# The branching rule for Schur polynomials

Setting the last variable of a Schur polynomial to `1` splits it into the Schur polynomials, in one
variable fewer, of the shapes that **interlace** its own:

`s_μ(x₀, …, x_{n-1}, 1) = ∑_{ν ≺ μ} s_ν(x₀, …, x_{n-1})`.

This is `TauCeti.eval_diagramSchurPoly_of_apply_last_eq_one`, stated as an identity between the two
*values*: both sides are evaluated, over an arbitrary commutative semiring, at an arbitrary family
whose last member is `1`.  Nothing here says that the two polynomials themselves agree after
specializing the last variable, which over a general semiring is a strictly stronger statement.
Over `ℂ`, and for a shape `μ` of at most `n + 1` rows — so that `μ` is the highest weight of a
polynomial irreducible of `GLₙ₊₁` and `s_μ` its character — the identity reads as the
multiplicity-free branching rule for the restriction `GLₙ₊₁ ↓ GLₙ`: that irreducible restricts to
the direct sum, each with multiplicity one, of the irreducibles whose highest weights interlace
`μ`.  That reading is not proved here, and it does not transfer to positive characteristic: there
the identity of characters no longer forces a direct-sum decomposition, because the representations
of `GLₙ₊₁` are not semisimple in general.  The theorems below are the evaluation identity alone.

Nothing analytic happens here.  `TauCeti.diagramSchurPoly` is by construction the generating
function of the bounded semistandard tableaux of its shape, so the identity is the sum-over-a-
partition form of the bijection `TauCeti.BoundedSSYT.fiberEquiv` of
`TauCeti.Combinatorics.Young.Interlacing`: a tableau in the `n + 1` letters `{0, …, n}` is a
tableau in the `n` letters `{0, …, n - 1}` on an interlacing sub-shape, together with the cells
carrying the top letter `n`.  Those cells contribute the variable that is being set to `1`, which
is exactly why the specialization, rather than the polynomial itself, is what factors.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.BoundedSSYT.weight_restrict`: the weight form of `TauCeti.BoundedSSYT.content_restrict`,
  that erasing the top letter of a tableau does not change how often any of the remaining letters
  occurs.
* `TauCeti.eval_diagramSchurPoly_of_apply_last_eq_one`: the branching rule, for any evaluation
  sending the last variable to `1`, and `TauCeti.eval_snoc_one_diagramSchurPoly`, its form for the
  evaluation built by appending `1` to a family of values.

/-- **The branching rule for Schur polynomials.**  Evaluating `s_μ` in `n + 1` variables at a
family whose last member is `1` gives the sum of the `s_ν` in the first `n` variables, over the
shapes `ν` interlacing `μ` with at most `n` rows, each occurring once.

The identity is one of values in an arbitrary commutative semiring, holding at every such family;
it is not stated as an equality of polynomials.  Over `ℂ`, and for a shape `μ` of at most `n + 1`
rows, it is the character form of the multiplicity-free branching rule for the restriction
`GLₙ₊₁ ↓ GLₙ`. -/
