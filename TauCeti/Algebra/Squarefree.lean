# Squarefree elements, squares, and squarefree parts

This file records a few general facts about squarefree elements, squares, and rational squares
that Mathlib does not provide directly, used across the multiquadratic development.

* `Squarefree.not_isSquare`: a squarefree non-unit of a monoid is not a square (the converse of
  Mathlib's `IsUnit.squarefree`). It is phrased with `Squarefree` dot-notation, so a caller
  holding `ha : Squarefree a` and `hu : ¬ IsUnit a` can write `ha.not_isSquare hu`.
* `Squarefree.neg`: negation preserves squarefreeness in any ring with distributive negation.
* `not_isSquare_intCast_of_squarefree_of_ne_one`: a squarefree integer other than `1` is not a
  rational square.
* `isSquare_mul_sq_iff`: in a commutative group with zero, multiplying by a nonzero square does
  not change squareness — the statement that squareness depends only on the square class.
* `Int.exists_squarefree_mul_sq` and `Rat.exists_squarefree_int_mul_sq`: the **squarefree part**.
  Every nonzero integer, and every nonzero rational, is a squarefree *integer* times a nonzero
  square. Mathlib has this for the natural numbers only (`Nat.sq_mul_squarefree`); these are the
  integer and rational forms, which is what a square-class argument over `ℚ` needs.

element does not change whether an element is a square. -/

/-- **The squarefree part of an integer.** Every nonzero integer is a squarefree integer times the
square of a nonzero integer. This is the integer form of Mathlib's `Nat.sq_mul_squarefree`; the
sign is carried by the squarefree factor. -/

/-- **The squarefree part of a rational number.** Every nonzero rational is a squarefree *integer*
times the square of a nonzero rational: its square class is represented by a squarefree integer.
This is what lets a square-class argument over `ℚ` work with squarefree integer radicands. -/
