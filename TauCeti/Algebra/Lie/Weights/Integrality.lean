# Integrality of the weights of a module over a semisimple Lie algebra

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over a field of
characteristic zero, let `H` be a splitting Cartan subalgebra, and let `M` be a finite-dimensional
`L`-module. This file proves that the weights of `M` are **integral**: for every weight `χ` of `M`
and every root `α`, the scalar `χ (α^∨)` is an integer.

The proof here is the standard reduction to rank one that organises the whole highest-weight
theory. A nonzero root `α` carries an `sl₂` triple `⟨eₐ, hₐ, fₐ⟩` with `eₐ ∈ Lα`, `fₐ ∈ L₍₋α₎` and,
by Mathlib's `IsSl2Triple.h_eq_coroot`, `hₐ = α^∨`. Restricting `M` along that triple turns
`χ (α^∨)` into an eigenvalue of the Cartan element of an `sl₂` triple on a finite-dimensional
module, and those are integers by `TauCeti.exists_int_of_hasEigenvalue`.

Two hypotheses that might be expected are absent. The base field is **not** assumed algebraically
closed: only the existence of the root system and of the triple attached to `α` is needed, and both
are available as soon as `H` is splitting (`LieModule.IsTriangularizable K H L`). And the weight
spaces are Mathlib's **generalized** weight spaces, which is all that is available before the
diagonalizability theorem for the Cartan action; a weight `χ` enters the argument only through
`LieModule.Weight.hasEigenvalueAt`, which extracts an honest eigenvector of a single `x : H` from a
nonzero generalized weight space.

The refinements `TauCeti.exists_nat_of_lie_coroot_eq_smul_of_forall_rootSpace_lie_eq_zero` and
`TauCeti.exists_nat_neg_of_lie_coroot_eq_smul_of_forall_rootSpace_neg_lie_eq_zero` replace `ℤ` by
`ℕ` and by `-ℕ` for a vector on which `α^∨` acts by a scalar and which is killed by the root space
`Lα`, respectively by `L₍₋α₎`: that is, for a highest, respectively lowest, weight vector in the
`α` direction. The first is the form in which the classification of the finite-dimensional
irreducibles consumes integrality: restricting a highest weight vector to the `sl₂` of each simple
root is what forces its weight to be dominant integral.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_int_of_hasEigenvalue_coroot`: every eigenvalue of a coroot `α^∨` acting on a
  finite-dimensional module is an integer.
* `TauCeti.exists_int_apply_coroot`: **integrality of weights.** For a weight `χ` of a
  finite-dimensional module and a root `α`, the value `χ (α^∨)` is an integer.
* `TauCeti.exists_int_apply_of_mem_span_coroot`: a weight of a finite-dimensional module is
  `ℤ`-valued on the whole coroot lattice, the `ℤ`-span of the coroots.
* `TauCeti.exists_nat_of_lie_coroot_eq_smul_of_forall_rootSpace_lie_eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.exists_nat_neg_of_lie_coroot_eq_smul_of_forall_rootSpace_neg_lie_eq_zero`: a nonzero
  vector on which `α^∨` acts by the scalar `μ` and which is killed by the root space `Lα`,
  respectively `L₍₋α₎`, forces `μ` to be a natural number, respectively minus a natural number.
* `TauCeti.genWeightSpaceOf_coroot_eq_bot_of_forall_ne_intCast`: the generalized eigenspace of a
  coroot at a non-integer scalar vanishes.

/-! ### The spectrum of a coroot -/

/-- **The eigenvalues of a coroot are integers.** Every eigenvalue of the action of a coroot `α^∨`
on a finite-dimensional module is an integer.

The weight `α` is arbitrary: the roots carry the content, while the coroot of a zero weight is zero
and has only the eigenvalue `0`. -/

/-- **No generalized eigenvalues of a coroot off the integers.** The generalized eigenspace of the
coroot `α^∨` on a finite-dimensional module vanishes at every scalar that is not an integer.

This is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: the hypothesis `hμ` cannot be discharged by `simp` from the
left-hand side alone. -/

/-! ### Integrality of weights -/

/-- **Integrality of the weights of a finite-dimensional module.** For every weight `χ` of a
finite-dimensional module `M` over a Killing-semisimple Lie algebra and every root `α`, the value
`χ (α^∨)` is an integer.

The nonzero weights `α` of `L` are the roots and carry the content; a zero weight has zero coroot,
and is allowed here only so that no side condition is carried around.

By `LieAlgebra.IsKilling.rootSystem_coroot_apply` the element `α^∨` is the coroot of the Mathlib
root system `LieAlgebra.IsKilling.rootSystem H`, so this is integrality in the sense that the
dominance conditions of the highest-weight classification use. -/

    ∃ z : ℤ, χ (IsKilling.coroot α) = (z : K) :=
  exists_int_of_hasEigenvalue_coroot (χ.hasEigenvalueAt _)

/-- **A weight is `ℤ`-valued on the coroot lattice.** The coroots of a Killing-semisimple Lie
algebra span a `ℤ`-lattice in the Cartan subalgebra, and every weight of a finite-dimensional
module takes integer values on it.

The span is over all weights of `L` rather than over the roots alone; the two agree, the coroot of
the zero weight being zero. -/

/-! ### Dominance along a root -/

/-- **A highest weight vector in the `α` direction has a natural coroot value.** If a nonzero `v` is
an eigenvector of the coroot `α^∨` of a nonzero root `α`, of eigenvalue `μ`, and is annihilated by
the root space `Lα`, then `μ` is a natural number.

This is the step that turns the highest weight of a finite-dimensional irreducible into a dominant
integral weight, applied to each simple root in turn. Only the action of `α^∨` on `v` is
constrained, and it is constrained by a genuine eigenvector equation, which is strictly stronger
than membership of a generalized weight space. -/

`v` is an eigenvector of the coroot `α^∨` of a nonzero root `α`, of eigenvalue `μ`, and is
