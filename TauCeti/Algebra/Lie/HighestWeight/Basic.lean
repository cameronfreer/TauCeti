# Highest weight vectors and dominant integral weights

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over a field of
characteristic zero, let `H` be a splitting Cartan subalgebra and let `b` be a base of the root
system `LieAlgebra.IsKilling.rootSystem H`, so that the nilradicals and the Borel subalgebra of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/Weights/Borel.lean` are available. This file introduces the two notions the
classification of the finite-dimensional irreducible modules is stated with, and proves the
implication between them that the rank-one theory already supplies.

A vector `v` of an `L`-module `M` is a **highest weight vector of weight `lam`** when it is
nonzero, when the Cartan subalgebra acts on it through the linear form `lam`, and when the whole
positive nilradical `n⁺` annihilates it (`TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector`). A linear form
`lam : Module.Dual K H` is **dominant integral** when its value on each simple coroot is a natural
number (`TauCeti.IsDominantIntegral`).

The main theorem is `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.isDominantIntegral`: the weight of a highest
weight vector in a *finite-dimensional* module is dominant integral. The proof is the rank-one
reduction, one simple root at a time. A simple root `αᵢ` is positive, so the root space `Lαᵢ`
annihilates `v`, and `v` is an eigenvector of `αᵢ^∨` with eigenvalue `lam (αᵢ^∨)`; that is exactly
the hypothesis of
`TauCeti.exists_nat_of_lie_coroot_eq_smul_of_forall_rootSpace_lie_eq_zero`, which produces the
natural number through the `sl₂` triple of `αᵢ`. Dominance then propagates from the simple coroots
to all the positive ones by pure root-system combinatorics
(`TauCeti.IsDominantIntegral.exists_nat_apply_coroot`), a positive coroot being a natural
combination of the simple coroots.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector b lam v`: `v` is nonzero, `H` acts on it by `lam`, and the
  positive nilradical of `b` annihilates it.
* `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.weight`: the weight of `M` that a highest weight vector exhibits.
* `TauCeti.IsDominantIntegral b lam`: the value of `lam` on every simple coroot is a natural
  number.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isHighestWeightVector_iff_forall_rootSpace`: it is enough to check that each *positive
  root space* annihilates `v`, the positive nilradical being spanned by them.
* `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.unique`: a vector is a highest weight vector for at most one
  weight.
* `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.mem_genWeightSpace` and
  `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.weight`: a highest weight vector really does exhibit `lam` as a
  weight of `M`, so the vocabulary is not vacuous.
* `TauCeti.IsDominantIntegral.exists_nat_apply_coroot`: a dominant integral weight takes natural
  values on *every* positive coroot, not only on the simple ones.
* `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.isDominantIntegral`: the weight of a highest weight vector in a
  finite-dimensional module is dominant integral.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector` is stated as the conjunction pinned by the roadmap rather than as a
structure, and `TauCeti.isHighestWeightVector_iff` together with the three projections
`TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.ne_zero`, `TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.lie_eq_smul` and
`TauCeti.IsHighestWeightVector.lie_eq_zero_of_mem_positiveNilradical` is its elimination API; no
consumer needs to take the conjunction apart by hand.

The annihilator of a vector is a Lie subalgebra, by the Leibniz rule, and that is the only reason
`TauCeti.isHighestWeightVector_of_forall_rootSpace` holds: the universal property
`TauCeti.positiveNilradical_le_iff` of the positive nilradical is stated against Lie subalgebras.
The annihilator is kept private, being a device of that one proof.

Finite-dimensionality of `M` is a hypothesis of the dominance theorem alone: the definitions and
the elimination API are stated for an arbitrary `L`-module, since the Verma modules that Layer 3 of
the roadmap builds next are infinite-dimensional and carry highest weight vectors all the same.

definition of Layer 4 of

`IsHighestWeightVector` and `IsDominantIntegral` are pinned in the accompanying `Suggested.lean`.

target is a Lie subalgebra rather than a submodule, is applied to in

/-- **The weight of a highest weight vector is dominant integral.** For a highest weight vector `v`
in a finite-dimensional module and a simple root `αᵢ`, the vector `v` is an eigenvector of the
coroot `αᵢ^∨` with eigenvalue `lam (αᵢ^∨)` and is annihilated by the root space `Lαᵢ`, simple roots
being positive; the `sl₂` triple of `αᵢ` then forces the eigenvalue to be a natural number.

This is the half of the highest-weight classification that the rank-one theory supplies on its own.
The converse, that every dominant integral weight is the weight of a highest weight vector in a
finite-dimensional module, needs the Verma modules and is not proved here. -/
