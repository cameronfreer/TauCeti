# The differential on derivations

A morphism `φ : A' →ₐc[R] A` of bialgebras sends a counit-valued derivation of `A` to
one of `A'` by precomposition. The construction splits the transport into the two halves
Mathlib provides: restricting the domain along `φ` (`Derivation.compAlgebraMap`, over
local scalar-tower instances for `φ`), and moving the coefficients across the canonical
identification of the two counit coefficient algebras, which is `A'`-linear precisely
because bialgebra morphisms intertwine counits (`LinearEquiv.compDer`). The Leibniz rule
therefore comes from those two facts and is not reproved here.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.derivationComp`: precomposition of counit-valued derivations along a
  bialgebra morphism, as an `R`-linear map — the derivation form of the differential.
* `TauCeti.derivationComp_apply`, `TauCeti.derivationComp_id`,
  `TauCeti.derivationComp_comp`: it acts by precomposition, functorially.

The intertwining with the tangent dictionaries is
`TauCeti.tangentKerMap_derivationMulEquivTangentKer` in
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.Tangent.Map`.

/-- **The two counit coefficient algebras agree, `A'`-linearly.** `Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra R A B`
and `Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra R A' B` are both copies of `B`, and the identification between them is
`A'`-linear exactly because a bialgebra morphism intertwines the counits
(`BialgHom.counitAlgHom_comp`). The `A'`-algebra structure on the `A`-side copy is not the global
one, so it is taken as an instance argument together with `hmap`, which says its structure map
factors through `φ` — the only property of it this construction uses. -/
