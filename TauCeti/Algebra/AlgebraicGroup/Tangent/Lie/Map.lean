# The differential is a Lie algebra morphism

Precomposition of counit-valued derivations along a bialgebra morphism
(`TauCeti.derivationComp`) preserves the convolution commutator: the differential of a
morphism of affine monoid schemes is a morphism of Lie algebras (ReductiveGroups
roadmap, Layer 2, "the differential of a homomorphism"). The bracket identity uses
only the coalgebra half of the morphism — it intertwines the convolution products
termwise; the algebra half already entered in `derivationComp`, which needs
`d (φ (x * y)) = d (φ x * φ y)` to produce a derivation at all.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.derivationComp_bracket`: the differential preserves the bracket.
* `TauCeti.derivationCompLieHom`: the differential as a morphism of Lie algebras.
