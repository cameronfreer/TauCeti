# The coordinate ring of a diagonalizable group is non-reduced in the presence of `p`-torsion

For a commutative group `G`, the diagonalizable group `D(G)` over `R` is `Spec R[G]`, with
coordinate Hopf algebra the group algebra `R[G]`. This file records the failure of `R[G]` to be
reduced whenever `R` has prime characteristic `p` and `G` has a nontrivial element killed by `p`.

The mechanism is the freshman's dream: if `g ≠ 1` with `g ^ p = 1`, then in characteristic `p`
the group-like element `single g 1` and the identity `1 = single 1 1` satisfy
`(single g 1 - 1) ^ p = single (g ^ p) 1 - 1 = single 1 1 - 1 = 0` by `sub_pow_char`, while
`single g 1 - 1 ≠ 0` because `single` is injective in its index. So `single g 1 - 1` is a nonzero
nilpotent and `R[G]` is not reduced.

The headline application is the **non-smooth example `μ_p` in characteristic `p`** from the
reductive-groups roadmap: `μ_p = D(ℤ/p)` has coordinate Hopf algebra
`R[Multiplicative (ZMod p)]`, whose `A`-points are the `p`-th roots of unity in `A`
(`TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.pointsMulEquiv`), yet which is non-reduced over a base of
characteristic `p`. Geometric reducedness of the coordinate ring is exactly smoothness for a
group scheme of finite type over a field, so this exhibits `μ_p` as a non-smooth (non-reduced)
affine group scheme, the canonical example the roadmap flags for admitting non-smooth groups.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.single_sub_one_pow_eq_zero`: `(single g 1 - 1) ^ p = 0` when `g ^ p = 1`, in
  characteristic `p`.
* `TauCeti.isNilpotent_single_sub_one`: the element `single g 1 - 1` is nilpotent.
* `TauCeti.single_sub_one_ne_zero`: `single g 1 - 1` is nonzero when `g ≠ 1`.
* `TauCeti.not_isReduced_monoidAlgebra`: `R[G]` is not reduced when `G` has nontrivial
  `p`-torsion and `R` has characteristic `p`.
* `TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.coordinateRing_not_isReduced`: the coordinate Hopf algebra of
  `μ_p = D(ℤ/p)` is not reduced over a nontrivial base of characteristic `p`.

This is a worked-example check for the reductive-groups roadmap
(`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap): the standing hypotheses note that an affine
group scheme of finite type "admits `μ_p`, `αₚ`, and other non-smooth / non-reduced groups", and
Layer 4 names "the non-smooth example `μ_p` in characteristic `p`" in the diagonalizable-groups
lane.

## References

The freshman's-dream identity `(x - y) ^ p = x ^ p - y ^ p` in characteristic `p` is Mathlib's
`sub_pow_char`; the monomial power law `single m r ^ n = single (m ^ n) (r ^ n)` is Mathlib's
`MonoidAlgebra.single_pow`; injectivity of `single` in its index is
`MonoidAlgebra.single_left_injective`.
The characteristic of the group algebra is transported from that of `R` along the injective
`algebraMap` (`charP_of_injective_algebraMap` with `FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective`). The
roots-of-unity group `μ_n = D(ℤ/n)` and its standard generator are Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup`.
