# The degree of a central simple algebra

A finite-dimensional central simple algebra has square dimension over its base field. This file
proves that, and defines the **degree** `TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A` as the square root of
`Module.finrank K A`.

The proof is the base-change one, and it needs no theory of maximal subfields. Let `L / K` be a
field extension with `L` algebraically closed. Then `L ⊗[K] A` is again simple, because `L` is a
simple `K`-algebra and `A` is central simple
(`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct_of_isCentral_right`); it is finite-dimensional over `L` of the
same dimension as `A` over `K` (`Module.finrank_baseChange`); so Mathlib's
`IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_isAlgClosed` writes it as `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) L`, whose
dimension is `n ^ 2`. Only simplicity of the scalar extension is used: the sharper statement that
`L ⊗[K] A` is central simple *over `L`* is not needed here, and is not proved.

Centrality of `A` over `K` is essential rather than decorative: `ℂ` is a simple, finite-dimensional
`ℝ`-algebra whose dimension `2` is not a perfect square. That negative control is checked at the end
of the file, alongside the real quaternions as the positive one.

The same argument says that an algebraically closed extension **splits** `A`, in `deg K A` rows and
columns; that is recorded as
`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_baseChange_of_isAlgClosed`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.isSquare_finrank`: **the dimension of a finite-dimensional central simple
  algebra is a perfect square**.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.deg`: the degree of a central simple algebra, with
  `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_sq : deg K A ^ 2 = Module.finrank K A`, its multiplicativity
  `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct` and `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_matrix`, the reading
  `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_eq_mul_deg_of_algEquiv_matrix` off a Wedderburn presentation, and the
  splitting `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_baseChange_of_isAlgClosed` restated with
  matrix size `deg K A`.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.finrank_tensorProduct_mulOpposite` and
  `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct_mulOpposite`: the dimension `(Module.finrank K A) ^ 2` and the
  degree `Module.finrank K A` of `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ`, for an arbitrary `K`-algebra `A`. These are the
  counts behind `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Opposite.lean`.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.Algebra.deg` is defined for every `K`-algebra, as `Nat.sqrt (Module.finrank K A)`, the way
`Module.finrank` is defined for every module. Its characteristic property is
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_eq_of_finrank_eq_sq`, which needs no hypotheses on `A` beyond the square
dimension it is handed: the value is therefore pinned down for every square-dimensional algebra,
central simple or not, and `Nat.sqrt` rounds down elsewhere. What central simplicity buys is that
the dimension *is* a square (`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_sq`), and with it the reading of `deg K A` as the
size of the matrix algebra `A` becomes over an algebraically closed extension. Every lemma here that
computes a degree is derived from `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_eq_of_finrank_eq_sq`, so a downstream proof
need never unfold the definition. The two exceptions do not compute a degree and go through
`Nat.sqrt` directly, because there is no square dimension to feed the characteristic property:
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_eq_of_algEquiv`, which only transports it along a linear equivalence, and
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_pos`, which only needs `Module.finrank_pos`.

`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.isSquare_finrank` covers every base field, so the finite-base-field
square-dimension statement that used to sit in `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Wedderburn.lean` is
gone, in favour of this one; that file keeps the matrix presentation
`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_finite`, which is genuinely special to a finite base
field and from which the square dimension used to be read off.

/-- **An algebraically closed extension splits a central simple algebra.** If `L / K` is a field
extension with `L` algebraically closed and `A` is a finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebra,
then `L ⊗[K] A` is a full matrix algebra over `L`, and its size `n` records the dimension of `A` as
`Module.finrank K A = n ^ 2`.

Centrality of `A` over `K` is what makes the scalar extension simple; simplicity of `A` alone does
not suffice. The standard witness is `A = ℂ` over `K = ℝ`, whose scalar extension `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂ` is a
product of two copies of `ℂ`; the shadow of that failure which is checked in this file is that
`Module.finrank ℝ ℂ = 2` is not a perfect square.

This is the private engine of the two public statements it splits into: the matrix size is a perfect
square root of the dimension (`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.isSquare_finrank`) and is therefore the degree,
so the splitting is stated downstream with the size named exactly, by
`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_baseChange_of_isAlgClosed`, rather than existentially
quantified. -/

/-! ### The degree -/

namespace Algebra

variable (K : Type*) [Field K] (A : Type*) [Ring A] [Algebra K A]

/-- The **degree** of a central simple `K`-algebra `A`: the square root of `Module.finrank K A`,
which is a perfect square by `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.isSquare_finrank`. Equivalently, the size of the
matrix algebra that `A` becomes over an algebraically closed extension of `K`
(`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_baseChange_of_isAlgClosed`).

This is defined for an arbitrary `K`-algebra. The characteristic property
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_eq_of_finrank_eq_sq` fixes the value whenever the dimension is a square, with
or without central simplicity; on an algebra whose dimension is not a square, `Nat.sqrt` rounds down
and the value carries no meaning. -/

/-- Passing to the opposite algebra does not change the dimension, so `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` has dimension
`(Module.finrank K A) ^ 2`. This is the count that turns injectivity of the Azumaya map into
surjectivity in `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Opposite.lean`, `Module.End K A` having the same
dimension, and it is where the matrix size in `TauCeti.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix` comes from: a
dimension, not a degree.

No finiteness hypothesis is needed: if `A` is infinite-dimensional both sides are `0`. -/
theorem finrank_tensorProduct_mulOpposite :
    Module.finrank K (A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ) = Module.finrank K A ^ 2 := by
  rw [Module.finrank_tensorProduct, ← (MulOpposite.opLinearEquiv K (M := A)).finrank_eq, sq]

/-- The degree of `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is the dimension of `A`. For `A` central simple this is the square
of the degree of `A` (`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_sq`), and it is the degree-level shadow of
`TauCeti.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix`: the reason the matrix size there is `Module.finrank K A`
rather than `TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A`.

As with the dimension count it rests on, no hypothesis on `A` is needed: the dimension of
`A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is a square for every `K`-algebra, and that alone pins the degree.

Not a `simp` lemma: as soon as `A` is central simple and finite-dimensional, so is `Aᵐᵒᵖ`, and then
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct` already rewrites the left-hand side, to
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A * TauCeti.Algebra.deg K Aᵐᵒᵖ`. Marking this one `simp` too would leave
`simp` with two different normal forms for the same term. -/
