# The chord and the arc on a circle

Mathlib's `Circle` carries both a metric, from the inclusion into `ℂ`, and an arc-length API:
`Circle.exp` parametrizes it by angles and `Circle.angleDiff x y` is the length of the arc running
counterclockwise from `x` to `y`. This file relates the two, comparing the *chord* `dist x y` with
the *arc* separating `x` from `y` in both directions, and transports the chord formula along the
translation and real scaling that carry `Circle.exp` to Mathlib's `circleMap ζ ρ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.dist_circleExp_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` — the chord subtended by an arc of angle `θ` of the
  unit circle has length `2 * |sin (θ / 2)|`.
* `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` — its form for the circle `circleMap ζ ρ` of arbitrary
  centre and radius, where the chord between the angles `θ` and `θ'` has length
  `2 * |ρ| * |sin ((θ - θ') / 2)|`, and
  `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_sin_abs`, the same formula with the sign of the angular
  difference cleared, valid for angles at most a full turn apart.
* `TauCeti.lipschitzWith_one_circleExp` and `TauCeti.diam_circleExp_image_Icc_le` — the chord is at
  most the arc, so an arc of angles of length `b - a` has image of diameter at most `b - a`.
* `TauCeti.min_angleDiff_le_pi_div_two_mul_dist` — the shorter of the two arcs joining two points of
  the circle has length at most `π / 2` times their distance.

## The argument

The first two are Mathlib's estimates for the normalized chord `‖exp (I * θ) - 1‖`, read off the
factorization `exp a - exp b = (exp (a - b) - 1) * exp b`: the chord formula is
`Complex.norm_exp_I_mul_ofReal_sub_one` and the Lipschitz bound is
`Real.norm_exp_I_mul_ofReal_sub_one_le`, so neither is derived from the other. The converse
comparison `TauCeti.min_angleDiff_le_pi_div_two_mul_dist` is Jordan's inequality `Real.mul_le_sin`
applied to the chord formula; it is the direction that turns a hypothesis about the ambient metric
into a bound on an arc, and so the one a transport argument such as
`TauCeti/Topology/JordanCurve/SmallArc.lean` consumes.

/-- **The chord of a circle of arbitrary centre and radius.** The two points of `circleMap ζ ρ` at
angles `θ` and `θ'` are at distance `2 * |ρ| * |sin ((θ - θ') / 2)|`; nothing is assumed of the
radius, a negative `ρ` tracing the same circle in the other sense.

This is the unit-circle formula `TauCeti.dist_circleExp_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` transported along the
translation and real scaling that carry `Circle.exp` to `circleMap ζ ρ`. -/

/-- **The chord with the sign of the angular difference cleared.** For angles at most a full turn
apart the chord `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` is `2 * |ρ| * sin (|θ - θ'| / 2)`: the
absolute value moves from outside the sine to inside it.

The width restriction is what makes the two forms differ: it puts the half-angle in `[0, π]`, where
the sine is nonnegative, and past a full turn the half-angle leaves that interval and `|sin|` and
`sin ∘ |·|` part company. Up to `π` the right-hand side is moreover an increasing function of the
angular gap, the half-angle then staying in `[0, π / 2]`; beyond `π` the formula still holds but the
chord shrinks again as the gap widens. -/

bound on an arc, and so the one a transport argument consumes. -/
