# Local connectedness passes to quotients

Local connectedness is not preserved by continuous images in general — every metric space is a
continuous image of a discrete one — but it *is* preserved by quotient maps, and hence by the
continuous images that are automatically quotient maps: those of a compact space in a Hausdorff
one. This file proves both, in the type-level form and in the set-level form
`TauCeti.locallyConnectedSpace_image_of_isCompact` that a subset of a topological space needs.

Mathlib has `LocallyConnectedSpace` with its `connectedComponentIn` characterization, and knows
that the property passes to open subspaces (`Topology.IsOpenEmbedding.locallyConnectedSpace`,
`IsOpen.locallyConnectedSpace`), but records no behaviour under quotients.

The proof is the standard one and uses `locallyConnectedSpace_iff_connectedComponentIn_open` on
both sides: for `V` open in the target and `y ∈ V`, the preimage of the connected component of `y`
in `V` is a union of connected components of the open set `q ⁻¹' V`, because a connected component
`C` of `q ⁻¹' V` has connected image inside `V`, so that image lies in a single component of `V`.
Those components are open downstairs by local connectedness, so the preimage is open, and the
component itself is then open because `q` is a quotient map.

The intended consumer is layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap, Carathéodory's boundary
correspondence: a conformal map that extends continuously to the closure of its domain carries a
locally connected boundary to a locally connected boundary, which is the necessary half of
Carathéodory's continuity theorem. That application is in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/LocallyConnectedBoundary.lean`; nothing here is specific to it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.locallyConnectedSpace_of_isQuotientMap` — a quotient of a locally connected space is
  locally connected.
* `TauCeti.locallyConnectedSpace_of_continuous_surjective` — the continuous image of a compact
  locally connected space in a Hausdorff space is locally connected.
* `TauCeti.locallyConnectedSpace_image_of_isCompact` — the set-level form: `f '' s` is locally
  connected for a compact, locally connected `s` on which `f` is continuous.

/-- **A quotient of a locally connected space is locally connected.** No separation or compactness
hypothesis is needed: being a quotient map is exactly what lets openness of the connected
components be transported downstairs.

Some hypothesis beyond continuity and surjectivity is needed: every metric space is the continuous
image of the same set with the discrete topology, which is locally connected. -/
