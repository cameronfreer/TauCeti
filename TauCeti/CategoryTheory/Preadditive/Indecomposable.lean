# Recognizing indecomposable objects from their endomorphisms

Mathlib defines `CategoryTheory.Indecomposable X` as the conjunction "`X` is not a zero object,
and in every decomposition `X ≅ Y ⊞ Z` one of `Y`, `Z` is zero", and proves exactly one criterion
for it: a simple object is indecomposable (`CategoryTheory.indecomposable_of_simple`). That
criterion is too strong for the objects that carry the theory of a finite-dimensional algebra: an
indecomposable projective module is almost never simple. The criterion that does apply is the one
this file supplies — an object all of whose idempotent endomorphisms are trivial is
indecomposable — together with the form in which it is used in practice: over a field, an object
whose endomorphism space is one-dimensional (a *brick*) is indecomposable.

Only one direction is proved. The converse needs a decomposition `X ≅ im e ⊞ ker e` attached to an
idempotent `e`, that is, idempotent completeness of the ambient category, which is a genuinely
extra hypothesis and is not needed by any consumer here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.indecomposable_of_idempotent_eq_zero_or_id`: a nonzero object whose only idempotent
  endomorphisms are `0` and the identity is indecomposable.
* `TauCeti.indecomposable_of_finrank_end_eq_one`: in a `k`-linear category over a field,
  **a brick is indecomposable**.

## Implementation notes

The idempotent hypothesis is phrased with composition, `e ≫ e = e`, rather than through the ring
`CategoryTheory.End X`, whose multiplication is composition in the opposite order; for an
idempotent the two agree, but the hypothesis is easier to discharge as stated.

`indecomposable_of_idempotent_eq_zero_or_id` extracts, from an isomorphism `X ≅ Y ⊞ Z`, the
idempotent `biprod.fst ≫ biprod.inl` transported to `X`. It is `0` exactly when `Y` is zero and the
identity exactly when `Z` is zero, so the hypothesis splits the decomposition; the proof reads off
`𝟙 Y` and `𝟙 Z` from it using only the biproduct equations `biprod.inl_fst`, `biprod.inr_snd` and
`biprod.inr_fst`.

That every endomorphism of a brick is a scalar is Mathlib's `finrank_eq_one_iff_of_nonzero'`
applied to the identity, which spans the endomorphism space because it is nonzero.

The brick criterion is stated for a field. The argument itself only inverts one scalar, so it
would run over a division ring, but `CategoryTheory.Linear` takes a commutative base and
`Module.finrank` is the invariant used by the consumers, so no generality is lost in practice.
