# Extending finite-dimensional smooth germs

A finite-order smooth germ on a finite-dimensional real normed space can be represented by a
globally smooth function of the same order. A smooth bump function performs the extension while
preserving the original function near the base point.

This general calculus lemma is used by the parameter-dependent ODE construction for the Lie-group
exponential.
