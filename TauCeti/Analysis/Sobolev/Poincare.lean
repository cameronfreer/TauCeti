# The Poincaré inequality fails on the whole space

A Poincaré inequality bounds the `Lᵖ` seminorm of a function by the `Lᵖ` seminorm of its
derivative, `‖u‖_p ≤ C ‖Du‖_p`. Mathlib proves such an estimate in
`MeasureTheory.eLpNorm_le_eLpNorm_fderiv`, for `1 ≤ p < n` and functions supported in a *fixed
bounded* set `s`, with the explicit `s`-dependent constant
`MeasureTheory.eLpNormLESNormFDerivOfLeConst ℝ μ s p p`. The PDE roadmap asks for the companion
fact that pins the role of that hypothesis: on the whole of a finite-dimensional space no single
constant works for *all* compactly supported functions, so the boundedness of the support is
load-bearing rather than an artefact of the proof.

The obstruction is scaling. Dilating the variable by `r > 0` multiplies `‖u‖_p` by `r ^ (n / p)`
and `‖Du‖_p` by `r ^ (n / p - 1)` (`TauCeti.eLpNorm_comp_inv_smul` and
`TauCeti.eLpNorm_fderiv_comp_inv_smul`), so applying a putative inequality to the dilates of one
fixed bump function forces `‖u‖_p ≤ C r⁻¹ ‖Du‖_p` for every `r`, and letting `r → ∞` makes the
bump's own seminorm vanish. Note that the two hypotheses `p ≠ 0` and `p ≠ ∞` are the only ones
needed: the failure is not confined to the subcritical range `p < n` in which the positive
result lives.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.not_exists_eLpNorm_le_const_mul_eLpNorm_fderiv`: no constant `C` satisfies
  `‖u‖_p ≤ C ‖Du‖_p` for all compactly supported `C¹` functions on a finite-dimensional real
  normed space with an additive Haar measure.
* `TauCeti.not_exists_eLpNorm_le_const_mul_eLpNorm_fderiv_euclideanSpace`: the roadmap's
  `ℝⁿ` form, for Lebesgue measure on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.

/-- **No Poincaré inequality holds on the whole space.** There is no constant `C` with
`‖u‖_p ≤ C ‖Du‖_p` for every compactly supported `C¹` function `u`, for any `0 < p < ∞`.

Compare `MeasureTheory.eLpNorm_le_eLpNorm_fderiv`, which supplies such a constant once every
`u` is supported in one fixed bounded set; the proof here shows that hypothesis cannot be
dropped. -/
