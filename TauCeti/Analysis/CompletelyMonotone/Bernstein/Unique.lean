# Uniqueness in Bernstein's representation theorem

A completely monotone function on `[0, ∞)` has a unique finite representing measure on `ℝ≥0`.
The existence half is supplied by Bernstein's theorem, while uniqueness follows from the fact
that a finite measure on `ℝ≥0` is determined by its Laplace transform.

This completes the existence-and-uniqueness direction of the Bernstein milestone in
`TauCetiRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`, Part B. The converse direction, asserting
complete monotonicity of Laplace transforms under the appropriate boundary regularity, is a
separate development.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.existsUnique_isFiniteMeasure_integral_exp_neg_mul_eq_of_isCompletelyMonotone`:
  every completely monotone function has a unique finite Laplace-representing measure.

/-- **Bernstein representation, existence and uniqueness.** A completely monotone function on
`[0, ∞)` is the Laplace transform of a unique finite positive measure on `ℝ≥0`.

This is the existence-and-uniqueness direction of Bernstein's theorem. The representing measure
is unique among all finite measures whose Laplace transform agrees with `f` at every nonnegative
real argument. -/
