# The Laplace kernel on `ℝ≥0`

The exponential kernel `p ↦ e^{-xp}` of the Laplace transform on `ℝ≥0`, as a plain function
and as a bundled bounded continuous function, together with its basic bounds and its
integrability against finite measures. This lightweight module is shared by the Chafaï
approximating-measure machinery and the Laplace-representation theory, which otherwise do not
depend on each other.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.laplaceKernelBoundedContinuous`: the kernel as a bounded continuous function.
* `TauCeti.integrable_exp_neg_mul`: the kernel is integrable against any finite measure.
