# Holomorphic branches of `log` and of `n`-th roots on a simply connected domain

Mathlib's `Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` produces a **continuous** branch of `log ∘ g`
on a simply connected open set. The Riemann-mapping argument needs a **holomorphic** one. This file
supplies that upgrade for the logarithm, consuming Mathlib's branch rather than rebuilding it, and
then obtains the `n`-th root from it directly as `exp (L / n)`.

Note that the root branch is *not* an upgrade of Mathlib's `Complex.exists_continuousOn_pow_eq`,
which this file does not use: once the logarithm branch is holomorphic, `exp (L / n)` is holomorphic
by composition and satisfies `(exp (L / n)) ^ n = exp L = g` outright, so routing through a separate
continuous root branch would add a second continuity-to-holomorphy argument for no gain.

The upgrade is local and purely formal. Near a point `z₀`, the continuous branch `L` agrees with
`logBranch w₀ ∘ g` where `w₀ = L z₀`, the branch of the logarithm based at `w₀`: that composite is
holomorphic (the argument sits near `1`, inside the slit plane, where `Complex.log` is), and it
agrees with `L` because continuity of `L` confines `L z - w₀` to the strip `|im| < π` on which that
branch inverts `Complex.exp`. So no new analysis is involved — only the observation that a
continuous logarithm of a holomorphic nonvanishing function is automatically holomorphic.

## Attribution and upstream coordination

The mathematics here is an upgrade of prior Mathlib work, not a first proof, and rests on two
efforts of Yury Kudryashov's.

*The branch itself* is Mathlib's: `Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` in
`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.BranchLogRoot` (© Yury Kudryashov) supplies the continuous logarithm
branch on a simply connected domain, which this file consumes rather than rebuilds. Everything
added below is the continuity-to-holomorphy upgrade. The `n`-th root is *not* obtained from
Mathlib's continuous root API (`Complex.exists_continuousOn_pow_eq` is never used here): it is
derived as `exp (L / n)` from the upgraded holomorphic logarithm branch `L`.

*The consumer* is the Riemann mapping construction in `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.RiemannMapping`
(© Yury Kudryashov), whose `Complex.exists_mapsTo_unitBall_injOn_deriv_ne_zero` performs the same
square-root step that the sibling file `DiscInjection.lean` re-derives on top of this API; see its
docstring for why that lemma cannot be named by an importer.

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves
holomorphic log / `n`-th-root statements (`exists_branch_log`, `exists_branch_nthRoot`)
**internally, as private lemmas**, alongside the argument principle, Hurwitz and Montel. The
`ConformalMapping` roadmap's stated contribution at these layers is therefore *named, reusable API*
rather than first proof. Accordingly the declarations here are a **temporary shim**: when the
human-curated Mathlib versions land, these should be deleted and every downstream consumer
refactored onto them.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_eqOn_exp_comp` — a holomorphic branch of `log ∘ g`.
* `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_pow_eq` — a holomorphic branch of `ⁿ√g`.
