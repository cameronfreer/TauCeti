# The endpoints of a circular crosscut

For a point `ζ` on `sphere c r` and a radius `ρ` with `0 < ρ < 2 * r`, the circle
`sphere ζ ρ` cuts the disc `ball c r` in one open arc. This file identifies that arc, its closed
companion, and its two endpoints exactly. If

* `α = arg (c - ζ)` is the direction from `ζ` to the centre, and
* `φ = arccos (ρ / (2 * r))` is the half-angle of the crosscut,

then the open and closed arcs are the images under `circleMap ζ ρ` of `(α - φ, α + φ)` and
`[α - φ, α + φ]`, while the two bounding circles meet at the images of the endpoints. Since
`φ < π / 2`, a crosscut spans less than a half turn, and the chord length along it is therefore
unimodal about any one of its points; that is what makes a crosscut *locally connected at its own
endpoints*, the last statement below.

This is the source-side endpoint interface needed by layer **L5** of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Jordan-domain case of Carathéodory boundary
correspondence. `Conformal/ShortCrosscut.lean` makes the image of the *open* arc arbitrarily short,
and `Conformal/CutDiameter.lean` asks local connectedness of the image boundary to join the two
ends by a small boundary set. The results here name those two ends and package the open arc together
with its closure; they do not assert the continuous boundary extension itself.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ball_inter_sphere_eq_circleMap_image_Ioo` and
  `TauCeti.closedBall_inter_sphere_eq_circleMap_image_Icc` identify the open and closed crosscut
  arcs.
* `TauCeti.sphere_inter_sphere_eq_pair_circleMap` identifies their two distinct endpoints.
* `TauCeti.isPathConnected_ball_inter_sphere` and
  `TauCeti.closure_ball_inter_sphere` give the corresponding topological packaging, and
  `TauCeti.nonempty_frontier_ball_inter_closure_ball_inter_sphere` records that a crosscut reaches
  the frontier of the disc.
* `TauCeti.isPreconnected_ball_inter_sphere_inter_ball` — a ball centred at a point of the closed
  crosscut meets the crosscut in a subarc: a crosscut spans less than a half turn, so along it the
  chord distance to a fixed one of its points falls and then rises, and the angles it keeps below a
  threshold form an interval. The chord length itself is measured by
  `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin`, in `TauCeti/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`. This is the
  local connectedness of a crosscut at its own endpoints,
  which `Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean` spends to make the cluster set of a conformal map at an end
  of an image crosscut a continuum.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort. Mathlib supplies `circleMap`, its periodicity and
injectivity on one period, inverse trigonometric functions, and the generic fact that two circles in
the plane meet in at most two points; none of the crosscut descriptions below is present there.

/-- **A circular crosscut of a disc reaches the boundary of the disc.** A crosscut spanning less
than a half turn has two endpoints (`TauCeti.sphere_inter_sphere_eq_pair_circleMap`), and either of
them lies on `sphere c r`, the frontier of the disc, and in the closure of the crosscut
(`TauCeti.closure_ball_inter_sphere`).

This is the form in which `Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean`, whose statements are about an arbitrary
domain, asks a cut to leave the domain at all. -/

/-- **A ball centred at a point of the closed crosscut meets the crosscut in a subarc.** A genuine
circular crosscut spans an angle `2 * arccos (ρ / (2 * r)) < π`, so along it the chord distance to
a fixed one of its points is unimodal; the part of the crosscut inside any ball centred at such a
point is therefore the image of an interval of angles, and in particular preconnected.

This is the local connectedness of a crosscut *at its own endpoints*, which is what the cluster set
of a map along a crosscut needs in order to be a continuum
(`TauCeti.isConnected_clusterSetOn`). The radius `δ` is arbitrary: for large `δ` the trace is the
whole crosscut. -/
