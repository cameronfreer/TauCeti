# Vitali's convergence theorem

Vitali's theorem upgrades pointwise convergence on a set with an accumulation point to locally
uniform convergence for a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions. This completes the
Vitali component of layer **L1 (normal families / Montel)** of the conformal-mapping roadmap.

The proof applies `TauCeti.montel` twice. First choose one locally uniform subsequential limit `g`.
For an arbitrary subsequence, Montel supplies a further locally uniform limit `q`. Both limits
agree on the pointwise convergence set, hence on the whole preconnected domain by Mathlib's
analytic identity theorem
`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_frequently_eq`. Thus every subsequence has a further
subsequence converging to `g`; the sequential convergence criterion, applied to continuous maps on
each compact subset, gives locally uniform convergence of the original sequence.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.vitali` — a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions which converges pointwise
  on a set with an accumulation point in the domain converges locally uniformly to a holomorphic
  function.
* `TauCeti.vitali_of_tendsto` — the same theorem with a prescribed pointwise limit on the
  convergence set.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, L0–L3
material overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505).
This file is therefore a **temporary shim**: if a human-curated Vitali theorem lands in Mathlib,
this statement should be backed by it, or deleted and its consumers refactored to the upstream API.

/-- **Vitali's convergence theorem.** Let `Ω` be an open preconnected subset of `ℂ`. A locally
bounded sequence of holomorphic functions on `Ω` which converges pointwise on a subset `A ⊆ Ω`
having an accumulation point in `Ω` converges locally uniformly on `Ω` to a holomorphic function.

The pointwise limit on `A` need not be supplied: its existence is enough to determine the
holomorphic limit uniquely. -/

/-- **Vitali's theorem with prescribed pointwise values.** Under the hypotheses of `vitali`, if
the sequence converges pointwise on `A` to a specified function `g`, its locally uniform
holomorphic limit agrees with `g` throughout `A`.

No regularity of `g` away from `A` is assumed or concluded. -/
