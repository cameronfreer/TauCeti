# The global branch of a germ on a simply connected domain

`Monodromy.lean` proves that analytic continuation along a path depends on the path only through
its homotopy class. This file draws the conclusion that makes monodromy usable: **on a simply
connected domain, a germ that continues along every path is the germ of a single holomorphic
function on the whole domain**. Equivalently, on such a domain continuation creates no new
branches, so "multi-valued analytic function" is a phenomenon of the topology of the domain and
not of the germ.

The hypothesis is `TauCeti.ContinuesInside f₀ U z₀` from `Conformal/Continuation.lean`: the germ
of `f₀` at `z₀` continues along *every* path in `U` issuing from `z₀`. It is exactly what a
holomorphic function on `U` supplies (`TauCeti.ContinuesInside.of_differentiableOn`), and by the
two-way form below it is supplied by nothing else once `U` is simply connected.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContinuesInside.eventuallyEq_at_one` — **path independence**: on a simply connected `U`,
  two continuations of one germ along two paths in `U` with the same endpoints end at the same
  germ.
* `TauCeti.ContinuesInside.exists_analyticOnNhd` — **the monodromy theorem for a simply connected
  domain**: a germ that continues along every path of a simply connected open `U` is the germ of
  a function analytic on all of `U`.
* `TauCeti.continuesInside_iff_exists_analyticOnNhd` — the two-way form on a simply connected open
  set: continuable along every path inside `U` ⟺ the germ of a function analytic on `U`.

The branch produced is unique as soon as `U` is preconnected, by the identity principle
(`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`); no uniqueness statement is added here.

## The construction

Path independence is monodromy plus simple connectivity: two paths in `U` with the same endpoints
lift to paths in the subspace `↥U`, where `SimplyConnectedSpace.paths_homotopic` produces a
homotopy rel endpoints; pushing that homotopy back down to `ℂ` keeps every intermediate path
inside `U`, so the hypothesis supplies a continuation along each of them and
`TauCeti.monodromy_theorem` applies. Uniqueness of continuation along a *fixed* path
(`TauCeti.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq`, over the preconnected parameter interval)
then matches the two given continuations with the two extreme members of that family.

The global branch is `F w = (value at w of the terminal germ of a continuation to w)`, chosen once
per point of `U` by path connectedness; path independence says the choice does not matter. The
work is in showing `F` analytic, that is, in comparing the terminal germs at two *different*
points. The comparison uses the metric stability of continuation
(`TauCeti.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.exists_isAnalyticContinuationAlong_of_dist_lt`): a
continuation along a path `δ` ending at `z` is carried by a family that continues along *every*
path uniformly `ρ`-close to `δ`, so the sheared path `x ↦ δ x + x • (w - z)`, which ends at a
nearby `w`, is continued by that same family. The shear leaves `δ` by less than `ρ`, and by less
than the distance from the compact set `δ '' I` to the complement of `U`, so it stays inside `U`
and path independence applies to it. Hence `F` agrees near `z` with a fixed analytic
representative of the terminal germ at `z`, which is what analyticity at `z` needs. The same
identification at `z₀`, applied to the constant path, is what gives `F` the prescribed germ
there.

## Relation to the roadmap and to Mathlib

This completes the L4 target "the monodromy theorem (continuations along homotopic paths agree)"
of `TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md` with the statement that layer is built for: the
passage from local germ data to a single-valued function on a simply connected domain, which is
what the reflection and continuation layers hand to their consumers. Layer L4 lies outside the
roadmap's shim-deletion clause for the upstream Riemann-mapping effort
(leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505), which contains no continuation or monodromy material.

Mathlib has the abstract monodromy statement `IsLocalHomeomorph.monodromy_theorem` and the lifting
criterion `IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts` for a simply connected base
(`Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/Lifting.lean`), but consuming them for germs of holomorphic functions
would first require the étale space of those germs as a topological space, which Mathlib does not
have; see the discussion in `Conformal/Monodromy.lean`. Mathlib's simple-connectivity API
(`SimplyConnectedSpace.paths_homotopic`, `IsSimplyConnected.isPathConnected`), its path homotopy
API (`Path.Homotopy.map`), and its metric thickening of a compact set are consumed rather than
restated.
