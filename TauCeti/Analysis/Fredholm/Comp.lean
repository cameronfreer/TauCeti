# Composition of Fredholm operators

This file proves that, over a complete nontrivially normed scalar field, the composite of two
Fredholm operators between normed spaces is Fredholm and that its index is the sum of their
indices. It also records the corresponding statements for powers of a Fredholm endomorphism.

Fredholmness of a composite follows by composing the continuous quasi-inverses supplied by
Mathlib's Fredholm API.
Index additivity reuses Mathlib's `LinearMap.index_comp`, whose proof is the six-term exact
sequence

`0 → ker T → ker (S ∘ T) → ker S → coker T → coker (S ∘ T) → coker S → 0`.

These results supply the compositional calculus for the Fredholm operators and index theory in
Lane F0 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.comp`: a composite of Fredholm operators is Fredholm.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.index_comp`: the index of a composite is the sum of the indices.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.pow`: every power of a Fredholm endomorphism is Fredholm.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.index_pow`: the index of the `n`th power is `n` times the index.

The conventions and the composition theorem follow McDuff--Salamon,
*J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A.1.
