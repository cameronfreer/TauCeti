# The mixing measure is identified by the i.i.d. mixture

The map `π ↦ π.bind (P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ})`, sending a measure on `ProbabilityMeasure α` to the law of a
sequence drawn i.i.d. from a `π`-random probability measure, is injective on finite measures.

## Main results

* `Measure.ext_of_bind_infinitePi_eq` — two finite measures on `ProbabilityMeasure α` inducing the
  same mixture are equal.

## Sources

The construction and proof plan follow the human-authored roadmap
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, *Layer 6 — directing measures and de Finetti
representation*, which names mixing-law uniqueness as the target this theorem serves.

## Implementation

Evaluating the mixture on a finite-dimensional rectangle gives the mixed moment
`∫⁻ P, ∏ i, P (B i) ∂π` of the evaluation maps. Nothing forces the sets `B i` to be distinct, so
listing `B j` exactly `m j` times turns the rectangle identity into one for the mixed monomial
`∏ j, (P (B j)) ^ m j` — this is the whole of the passage from rectangles to moments, and it is
where the argument gains its strength.

From there the two imported ingredients finish it. A finite evaluation family takes values in the
compact box `[0,1]^k`, so `Measure.ext_of_forall_integral_monomial_eq_of_support` identifies its
law from those monomials; and `Measure.ext_of_forall_map_probabilityMeasure_eval_eq` promotes
agreement of every finite evaluation law to equality of the measures.

Only `π₁` is assumed finite. Every infinite product of probability measures is a probability
measure, so the mixture has the same total mass as its mixing measure, and equality of the two
mixtures transfers finiteness to `π₂`.

/-- **The i.i.d. mixture determines the mixing measure.** If two finite measures on
`ProbabilityMeasure α` induce the same mixture `π.bind (P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ})`, they are equal.

The mixture's finite-dimensional rectangle probabilities are the mixed moments of the evaluation
maps, and repetitions in the rectangle turn those into mixed monomials. Each finite evaluation
family lands in the compact box `[0,1]^k`, so multivariate moment determinacy identifies its law,
and finite evaluation laws determine the measure. -/
