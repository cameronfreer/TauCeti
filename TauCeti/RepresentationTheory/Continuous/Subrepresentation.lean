# Restricting a continuous representation to an invariant submodule

This file restricts a continuous representation of a monoid to a submodule preserved by every
action operator, the continuous counterpart of Mathlib's `Representation.subrepresentation`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.subrepresentation`: the restriction of a continuous representation to
  an invariant submodule.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.toRepresentation_subrepresentation`: the underlying representation of
  a restricted continuous representation is the restriction of the underlying representation.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.continuous_subrepresentation`: the restriction of a continuous
  representation to an invariant submodule is again continuous.

/-- Restricting a continuous representation to an invariant submodule preserves continuity: from
continuity of `g ↦ π g` as a map into the continuous linear endomorphisms of `V`, the restricted
action `g ↦ subrepresentation π W hW g` is continuous into those of `W`. This supplies the
continuity argument that `matrixCoeff` and the rest of the continuous-representation API take
explicitly, so a subrepresentation can be used wherever a continuous representation is expected. -/
