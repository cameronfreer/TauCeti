# The path algebra of an acyclic quiver

A finite quiver with finitely many arrows between any two vertices has finitely many paths when it
is acyclic, and the paths are a basis of its path algebra; so the path algebra of such a quiver is
finite-dimensional over a division ring.

This is the only place the generic path algebra of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.PathAlgebra.Basic` meets acyclicity, which is why it is a
module of its own: the path algebra itself needs nothing from the theory of acyclic quivers.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_of_isAcyclic`: the path algebra of a finite acyclic
  quiver with finite arrow types is finite-dimensional.
