# Irreducible characters are linearly independent

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible.
The characters of pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations of `G` are orthonormal for
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing`, by Mathlib's first orthogonality relation. A family
that is orthogonal for a bilinear form and has nonzero self-pairings is linearly independent, so
those characters are linearly independent over `k`, both as class functions and as functions
on `G`.

Two consequences follow at once. An irreducible representation is determined by its character:
two irreducibles with the same character are equivalent, since otherwise a self pairing of `1`
would also have to be the cross pairing `0`. And a family of pairwise inequivalent irreducibles
has at most as many members as `G` has conjugacy classes, because the class functions have
exactly that dimension.

That last bound is in fact an equality, and the equality would upgrade the linear independence
proved here to a basis of the class functions. Its other half is the roadmap's Layer 2 count,
which runs through Wedderburn and the dimension of the centre of `k[G]`, and it is not available:
`TauCeti.card_eq_card_conjClasses_of_algEquiv_pi_matrix` supplies that count only for the
Wedderburn blocks of `k[G]`, which are not yet matched up with the irreducible representations
themselves. Nothing below uses it, and the two statements that would need it, that the irreducible
characters span the class functions and that they form a basis of them, are not stated here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_ofCharacter` and
  `TauCeti.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_character`: **the characters of pairwise inequivalent
  irreducible representations are linearly independent**, as class functions and as functions
  on `G`; `TauCeti.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_ofFDRep` and
  `TauCeti.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_character_fdRep` are the `FDRep` mirrors.
* `TauCeti.Representation.nonempty_equiv_of_character_eq` and
  `TauCeti.FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq`: **an irreducible representation is determined by
  its character**.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.card_le_card_conjClasses` and
  `TauCeti.ClassFunction.card_le_card_conjClasses_fdRep`: **there are at most as many pairwise
  inequivalent irreducibles as there are conjugacy classes**.

## Implementation notes

Nothing here mentions `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing`, which is defined for a `Fintype`:
the pairing enters only through the split orthonormality lemmas of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Pairing.lean`, so these statements ask for
`Finite G` and produce the `Fintype` inside their proofs.

## References

* [Character theory roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/blob/main/TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md).
  Everything here is proved from Layer 0's `characterPairing` and its orthonormality, which are on
  `main`, together with Mathlib's `char_orthonormal`; no Layer 1, Layer 2 or Layer 3 material is
  used, and none is presupposed. What the file supplies is prerequisite material for the later
  layers: that a character determines its irreducible is the injectivity of the map
  `character : Irreps k G → ClassFunction k G` that Layer 2.5 asks for, and the cardinality bound
  is the `≤` half of Layer 2's count `Nat.card (Irreps k G) = Nat.card (ConjClasses G)`, obtained
  without Wedderburn. Layer 3's completeness item, the spanning statement and the orthonormal
  basis indexed by `Irreps k G`, is not advanced here: it needs both that indexing and that count,
  and neither is in the repository yet.
