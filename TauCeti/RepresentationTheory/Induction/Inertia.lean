# The inertia group of a representation of a normal subgroup

Let `N` be a normal subgroup of `G`.  Conjugation makes `G` act on `FDRep k N`
(`TauCeti.conjNormalFDRepMulAction`), and the *inertia group* of `A : FDRep k N` is the stabilizer
of the isomorphism class of `A`,

`inertia A = {g : G | {}^g A ≅ A}`.

This is not `MulAction.stabilizer G A`, which asks for `{}^g A = A` on the nose; the two are
compared in `TauCeti.stabilizer_le_inertia`.  Instead, isomorphism classes of objects of a
category are Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Skeleton`, and conjugation descends to them because it is a
*functor*; that descent is the `MulAction` instance
`TauCeti.conjNormalFDRepSkeletonMulAction` of the conjugation file, and `inertia A` is literally
`MulAction.stabilizer G (toSkeleton A)`.  Everything else — that the inertia group is a subgroup,
that it only depends on the isomorphism class, and that conjugating the representation conjugates
it — is then Mathlib's generic stabilizer API.

The inertia group contains `N` (`TauCeti.le_inertia`), because conjugating by an element `n` of `N`
itself is an inner twist: `A.ρ n` intertwines `{}^n A` with `A`
(`TauCeti.conjNormalFDRepIso`).  Together with the normality of `N` inside `inertia A`, which
Mathlib's `Subgroup.normal_subgroupOf` instance supplies for any subgroup of `G`, this is what makes
the quotient `inertia A / N` — where the Clifford-theory obstruction lives — available.

Nothing here needs `A` to be irreducible: the inertia group is defined for every
finite-dimensional representation of `N`, and irreducibility only enters later, when Clifford's
theorem identifies the constituents of a restriction with a single `G`-orbit.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.inertia`: the inertia group of a representation of a normal subgroup.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.mem_inertia_iff`: membership in the inertia group is the existence of an isomorphism
  `{}^g A ≅ A`.
* `TauCeti.le_inertia`: the inertia group contains `N`.
* `TauCeti.inertia_congr`: isomorphic representations have the same inertia group, so the inertia
  group is an invariant of the isomorphism class.
* `TauCeti.inertia_conjNormalFDRep`: conjugating the representation conjugates its inertia group.
* `TauCeti.char_conj_eq_of_mem_inertia`: the character of `A` is invariant under conjugation
  by an element of the inertia group.

This file builds the inertia group of Layer 5 (Clifford theory over a normal subgroup) of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`, which asks for
"the **inertia (stabilizer) group** `inertia V ≤ G` of an irreducible `V : FDRep k N` is
`{g : G | {}^g V ≅ V}`, a subgroup containing `N`", and pins `inertia`, `mem_inertia_iff` and
`le_inertia` in the accompanying `Suggested.lean`.
