# The pairing of two permutation characters counts double cosets

The character of a permutation representation `k[X]` counts fixed points, so the normalized
pairing of two permutation characters is the Burnside average
`|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, |X^g| · |Y^g|`, which counts the orbits of `G` on `X × Y`.  Taking `X = G ⧸ H` and
`Y = G ⧸ K` and identifying those orbits with double cosets gives

`⟨Ind_H^G 1, Ind_K^G 1⟩_G = #(H \ G / K)`,

the pairing of two induced trivial representations.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.sum_character_ofMulAction_mul_character_ofMulAction_eq_card_orbits_mul_card_group`:
  Burnside's lemma as an unnormalized identity of character sums.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_ofMulAction_eq_card_orbits`: the pairing of two permutation characters
  is the number of orbits of `G` on the product.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_ofMulAction_quotient_eq_card_doubleCosetQuotient`: the specialization
  to two coset spaces, whose value is the number of double cosets.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_trivial_eq_card_doubleCosetQuotient`: the same value for the
  pairing of two induced trivial representations.

## Implementation notes

All the identities are equalities in the coefficient field `k`, with the counts cast into `k`, and
the normalized ones assume `IsUnit (Nat.card G : k)` so that the `|G|⁻¹` in
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing` is meaningful.  No algebraic closure and no orthogonality
of irreducible characters is used: the proof is Burnside's lemma, not a decomposition of the
permutation representation into irreducibles.  In particular the statements are valid in
characteristic `p` for `p ∤ |G|` and without assuming `k` algebraically closed; Maschke's theorem
does make the permutation representation semisimple under exactly this hypothesis, but nothing
below uses that, only the fact that its character counts fixed points.

The pairing `⟨χ, ψ⟩ = |G|⁻¹ ∑ g, χ g * ψ g⁻¹` is bilinear rather than Hermitian, and the inversion
in its second argument is exactly what `MulAction.fixedBy_inv` absorbs.

This is the "`⟨Ind_H^G 1, Ind_H^G 1⟩_G = #(H \ G / H)`" clause of the permutation-character item of
Layer 2 in `TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`, proved here for
two possibly different subgroups.
