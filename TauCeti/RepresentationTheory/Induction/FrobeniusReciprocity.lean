# Frobenius reciprocity as a character identity

For a finite-index subgroup `S` of a group `G`, Mathlib's adjunction `Rep.indResAdjunction`
identifies `Hom_G(Ind_S^G A, B)` with `Hom_S(A, Res_S B)`.  This file transports that adjunction to
finite-dimensional representations and reads it off as an identity of character scalar products:

`⟨Ind χ, ψ⟩_G = ⟨χ, Res ψ⟩_S`,

together with the identity in the other direction `⟨Res ψ, χ⟩_S = ⟨ψ, Ind χ⟩_G`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.finrank_hom_indFDRep`, `TauCeti.finrank_hom_resFDRep`: the paired intertwining spaces
  have the same dimension.
* `TauCeti.frobenius_reciprocity` and `TauCeti.frobenius_reciprocity_resFDRep`: the character form
  in both directions, with all scalar products written out as explicit normalized sums.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_indFDRep`, `TauCeti.characterPairing_resFDRep`: the same two identities
  phrased against `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing`.
* `TauCeti.card_inv_mul_sum_character_indFDRep`: reciprocity against the trivial representation,
  which says that induction does not change the (normalized) average of a character.

## Implementation notes

Only the coefficient field and the invertibility of `Nat.card G` are assumed; no algebraic closure
is needed, because each side is computed by
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_ofFDRep_eq_finrank` rather than by orthogonality of
irreducible characters.  Invertibility of `Nat.card S` is not a separate hypothesis: it follows
from `Subgroup.card_mul_index`.

That pairing-to-dimension lemma computes `⟨χ_V, χ_W⟩` as `finrank k (W ⟶ V)`, exchanging the two
arguments.  So the identity stated in the order `⟨Ind χ, ψ⟩ = ⟨χ, Res ψ⟩` is read off the *second*
reciprocity, `finrank_hom_resFDRep`.  The identity in the order `⟨Res ψ, χ⟩ = ⟨ψ, Ind χ⟩` is then
just that one with both sides flipped, by `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_symm`, so it is
derived rather than proved again from `finrank_hom_indFDRep`.  Neither direction needs a reindexing
of the sums.

The two `k`-linear equivalences of intertwining spaces that carry the reciprocities are private:
only their `finrank` corollaries are intended as API, and both are opaque transports whose bodies
would have to be exposed before a consumer could identify the transported intertwiner.

Both sides are written as explicit normalized sums, so the statement does not depend on the name of
any particular pairing; `TauCeti.characterPairing_indFDRep` is the same identity phrased against
